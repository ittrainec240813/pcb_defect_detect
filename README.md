# pcb_defect_detect
This system incorporates multiple robust AI technologies to streamline corporate workflows and enhance knowledge management. Leveraging YOLO v8 for defect detection ensures state-of-the-art performance in visual analysis, which is crucial for accurate, efficient defect categorization. Additionally, customizing an LLM with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) effectively enables a more contextual, domain-specific knowledge interface, ideal for users consulting specialized industry information.
The memory control feature in the LLM is able to improve response relevance by managing context efficiently, which can be critical in corporate environments where users may require continuity in complex interactions over multiple queries.

On the tech stack, using React for the frontend provides flexibility and responsiveness, and combined with FastAPI on the backend, it forms a highly scalable, cross-platform solution that can handle real-time data flows with WebSocket support. This backend configuration also sets the system up well for future feature expansion, like connecting external devices for real-time updates, which adds significant value for potential use cases needing immediate data synchronization.
